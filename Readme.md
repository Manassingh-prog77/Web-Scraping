# Web Scraping Project

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas to scrape data from an e-commerce website for a specific query and page range. The scraped data includes only image links, which are processed and stored in a CSV file for further use.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automates the process of fetching image links from an e-commerce website for a given search query and page range.
- **Data Processing**: Extracts image links from the raw HTML using BeautifulSoup.
- **Data Storage**: Saves the extracted image links into a CSV file using Pandas for easy access and analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for automation and data handling.
- **Selenium**: For navigating through the website and handling dynamic content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing and extracting image links from HTML content.
- **Pandas**: For organizing and storing data in a CSV file.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas
   ```

3. **Download WebDriver**:
   - Install the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome).
   - Add the WebDriver to your system PATH.

4. **Run the Script**:
   Modify the script to include your desired query and page range, then execute it:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Input Query and Page Range**:
   - The script takes a search query and page range as inputs.

2. **Web Navigation with Selenium**:
   - Selenium automates the browser to navigate to the e-commerce website.
   - It iterates through the specified page range to fetch the required data.

3. **Image Link Extraction with BeautifulSoup**:
   - Extracts image links from the HTML structure of the website using BeautifulSoup.

4. **Data Storage with Pandas**:
   - Organizes the extracted image links into a structured format.
   - Saves the data as a CSV file for further use.

## CSV Output
The CSV file contains columns such as:
- Image Link

## Example Output
An example row in the output CSV file:
```
Image Link
"https://example.com/image1.jpg"
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Browser and corresponding WebDriver (e.g., Google Chrome + ChromeDriver)

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more e-commerce websites.
- Include error handling for dynamic content and network issues.
- Visualize the data using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
